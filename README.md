- Present a comparative report and select the top two blockchains for further development.

### 2. Development of Proof of Concept:
- Design and develop adapter modules for each of the selected blockchains within six weeks.
- Execute a cross-chain transaction as a proof of concept with detailed documentation on the process.
- Collect feedback on the adapter modules from a select group of technology experts.

### 3. Stakeholder Engagement:
- Identify and initiate contact with at least ten blockchain service providers by the second month to garner support and partnerships.
- Establish engagement metrics such as the number of active dialogues and partnership agreements signed.

## Measurable Goals to Track Progress:

### 1. Template Library Construction:
- Outline a comprehensive collection of ten core smart contract templates addressing a range of digital marketing agreements.
- Develop and test a user interface prototype for contract customization tracked via user-test sessions and iterations.

### 2. Market Research and Analysis:
- Gathering and analysis of market data to produce an exhaustive report on digital marketing needs and blockchain readiness within the next 30 days.
- Quantify the report findings with at least 20 unique use cases for the OpenMarketing platform.

## Achievable Steps Set Forth:

- Structure at least five modules for an online educational portal tailored to developers and marketers.

### 2. Community Development:
- Assemble an online forum or community platform that will launch concurrently with the educational portal.
- Reach a membership milestone of 100 active participants within the first two weeks post-launch.

## Relevant Activities to the Project’s Future:

### 1. Governance Structure Establishment:
- Establish a draft model for the OpenMarketing DAO's governance mechanisms within 45 days.
- Define the initial governance token distribution strategy that incentivizes and rewards community governance participation.

### 2. Pre-Launch Marketing:
- Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy focused on blockchain and digital marketing audiences, to be deployed as soon as funding is secured.
- Plan and schedule at least three community calls aimed at engaging potential users and discussing the platform’s direction.

## Time-bound Commitments:

### 1. Funding and Resource Allocation:
- Secure commitments for initial funding within the 90-day goal to ensure uninterrupted progress into Phase 2.
- Complete a financial and resource needs assessment within the first month.
- Finalize the schedule for the development roadmap, legal compliance checks, and marketing deployment.

### 2. Strategic Partnerships and Network Building:
- Forge at least two strategic partnerships with industry leaders within the digital marketing and blockchain sectors by the end of Phase 1.
- Engage with potential advisors and mentors, aiming for a panel of at least five experts to provide guidance.

This Phase 1 approach serves as a concrete step towards establishing a well-defined and actionable plan. Each objective and goal is created to bring the OpenMarketing vision closer to reality, forming a base that is both strong and adaptable for future phases.
